# Operating System
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating systems acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video games consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

The main functions of an OS are:
- Process Administration
- Memory (RAM) Administration
- Device Administration
- Information Administration

# Types of operating systems
### Single-tasking and multi-tasking
The difference between these two are self-explanatory, the *single-tasking* can only run **one task at the time**, while *multi-tasking* is **capable of running two or more task at the same time**.

### Single-user and multi-user
These two are also self-explanatory, the *single-user* **doesn't have the ability to distinguish between users** while the *multi-user* **can identify processes and resources belonging to one or more users**.
